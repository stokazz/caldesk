## Recent Changes - MANUAL-ONLY ATTENDANCE SYSTEM (August 1, 2025)

### Complete Removal of Automatic Clock In/Out System
- **Frontend Simplification**: Removed all clock-in/clock-out buttons and logic from AttendanceWidget
- **Backend Cleanup**: Removed `/api/attendance/clock-in`, `/api/attendance/clock-out`, and `/api/attendance/auto-clock-out` endpoints
- **Manual-Only Approach**: System now relies entirely on manual attendance entry with precise time control
- **Time Display**: Widget now shows current time with "Solo Inserimento Manuale" message
- **Simplified User Experience**: No more confusion between automatic and manual systems
- **Precise Control**: Users can specify exact working hours (07:30-12:00, 13:00-16:45) without automatic interference

## Previous Changes - VACATION CALCULATION SYSTEM COMPLETE (August 1, 2025)

### Dynamic Vacation Calculation per Employee
- **User-Specific Working Hours**: System now checks each employee's individual `dailyWorkingHours` before vacation deductions
- **Proportional Vacation Days**: Vacation days calculated as ratio of actual working hours to standard 8-hour day
- **Smart Day Detection**: Automatically detects non-working days (0 vacation deduction) vs partial days (proportional deduction)
- **Example Logic**: Kevin Saturday 4h = 0.5 vacation days, Kevin Sunday 0h = 0 vacation days, Kevin weekdays 8h = 1.0 vacation days
- **Backend Validation**: Server validates working days per user before processing vacation requests
- **Data Integrity**: Corrected existing records to reflect proper vacation calculations and working hours

## Previous Changes - ATTENDANCE FIXES COMPLETE (August 1, 2025)

### Employee Settings & Statistics Enhancement
- **Employee Statistics Dashboard**: New comprehensive statistics section with vacation balance, overtime totals, and current work hours
- **Vacation History Tracking**: Added "Ultime scalate" section showing last 3 vacation deductions with dates and days used
- **Enhanced Work Schedule Display**: Completely redesigned daily schedule interface with gradients, icons, and color-coded categories
- **Modern Card Design**: Professional cards with hover effects, proper spacing, and visual hierarchy
- **Overtime Statistics**: Real-time calculation of total overtime hours, monthly breakdown, and weekend work tracking
- **Improved Vacation Balance**: Dynamic calculation based on actual vacation records with proper deduction tracking
- **Visual Improvements**: Removed non-paid break display, enhanced UI with modern gradients and better responsive design

### Critical Bug Fixes - Manual Attendance System
- **NaN Hours Bug Fixed**: Backend now prioritizes frontend calculations over timestamp parsing to prevent invalid hours
- **Mixed Day Vacation Logic**: Partial vacation days calculated correctly (4/8 hours = 0.5 days) for mixed work+vacation days
- **Responsive Modal Layout**: Mixed day modal now properly scrollable with responsive grid layout and accessible buttons
- **Calculation Priority**: Frontend hour calculations take precedence over backend timestamp calculations for accuracy

### Task Management System Completed
- **Task Creation & Assignment**: SuperAdmin can create tasks with flexible assignment (specific users or unassigned for self-assignment)
- **Self-Assignment System**: Employees can view and claim unassigned tasks from "Task Disponibili" section
- **Task Completion**: Streamlined completion workflow with green "üéØ COMPLETA TASK" button positioned between Annulla/Aggiorna buttons
- **Task Display**: Cards show assigned user names (simplified format like "KP") and due dates with Italian formatting
- **Default Filtering**: Tasks page opens with "In attesa" filter instead of showing all tasks
- **Comments System**: Full commenting functionality on tasks with real-time updates
- **Permission Handling**: Smart fallback for user display when access is restricted (403 errors)
- **UI Polish**: Single X button on modals, clean layout with proper spacing

### Key Features Implemented
- **Unassigned Task Logic**: Backend properly handles null assignments and "unassigned" values
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Employees can only modify their assigned tasks, admins have full access
- **Visual Indicators**: Priority icons (‚ö° ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚Üë -), completion status with green checkmarks and strikethrough
- **Italian Localization**: Date formats, button labels, and messaging all in Italian
- **Real-time Updates**: Task status changes reflect immediately across the interface
